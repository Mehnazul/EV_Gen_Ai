# 🚗 AI-Powered Route & Charging Optimization for Electric Vehicles

**Internship Theme:** Electric Vehicle  
**Technology:** Generative AI  
**Organization:** Edunet Foundation – AICTE Skills for Future

## 🧠 Objective
To use Generative AI to suggest optimized travel routes and charging plans for EV users, reducing range anxiety and improving travel efficiency.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Folium (Map Visualization)  
- Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2 Medium)  
- Google Colab  

## 📊 Project Features
- Visualization of 100+ EV charging stations across India.  
- Generative AI text model suggesting efficient charging routes.  
- Example Route: Chennai → Coimbatore (optimized with charging stops).  

## 📁 Files
- `Week2_EV_Project.ipynb` – Source Notebook  
- `ev-charging-stations-india.csv` – Dataset  

## ✨ Output Example
> From Chennai to Coimbatore – Start with 80% charge, stop at Vellore EV Charger after 210 km, then reach Coimbatore with 40% battery left.
