# 🚗 AI-Powered Route & Charging Optimization for Electric Vehicles

### 👩‍💻 Internship: AICTE – Edunet Foundation (Skills4Future)
**Theme:** Electric Vehicles  
**Technology Used:** Generative AI  
**Project Type:** Data Visualization + AI Text Generation  
**Language:** Python  
**Environment:** Google Colab

## 📘 Project Overview

Electric Vehicle (EV) users often face **range anxiety** — the fear of running out of battery before reaching a charging station.  
This project uses **Generative AI** to help EV drivers plan optimized travel routes with the best charging stops in between.

The system visualizes **real EV charging stations across India** on an interactive map and uses a **Generative AI text model (GPT-2)** to generate smart route suggestions between cities.

## 🎯 Objective

- To analyze and visualize EV charging station data across India.  
- To build a Generative AI model that suggests optimized EV routes.  
- To reduce range anxiety by recommending the best charging points.  
- To demonstrate how AI can improve electric mobility planning.
